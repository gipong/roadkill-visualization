## Abstract
This set of slides is an introduction to geospatial data visualization with roadkill data. It will show how to construct geospatial objects from tabular vector data or shapefiles. To work with these geospatial data in Python, we can use GeoPandas, shapely or related libraries for manipulating and analyzing the data. This slideset will also cover the following parts: loading data from CSV and shapefile, visualizing geospatial data with matplotlib and folium, using spatial operations to make thematic maps, fetching the street newtorks from OpenStreetMap, as well as visualizing them with the osmnx package. All of our datasets come from the research data repository [data.depositar.io](https://data.depositar.io/) except street networks data. The techniques presented here can be used for advanced spatial analysis and for exploring spatial relation in various application scenarios.
